# Tools

Tools change how the user interface interprets key presses and mouse inputs.  By switching tools, you can perform different tasks in Cyclops.

## Available tools


There are several tools in the toolbar that let you create and edit blocks:

## Common Features

Most tools will be able to do the following things.  However, each tool can provide custom handling for any key or mouse input, so some tools will override these.

* Escape - Cancel a tool editing action that is currently in progress
* Alt Q - Make the closest block under the mouse cursor the active block.
* X - Delete all selected blocks.
